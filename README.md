# SLAM BOT

**Aim:** SLAM is an acronym for simultaneous localization and mapping, a technology whereby a robot
or a device can create a map of its surroundings and orient itself properly within the map in real time.
SLAM bot which uses latest technology like ROS (Robotic Operating System) with Raspberry Pi
and also interfaced with RP Lidar a 360-degree Lidar, which sends those Laser scan value to map the
environment.

# SLAM BOT

### ABSTRACT:

```
This is one of the bots, which has simple structure uses ROS (Robotic Operating System) software
library of version ROS Kinetic booted with Raspberry Pi and also interfaced with RPLidar in the
front top portion of the Bot. This low-cost mapping bot emerges with features like SLAM
(Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). which has the capability to form the Map of the
environment using Lidar scans using Matlab’s Robotic Operating System Software package to
communicate with ROS in the Raspberry Pi using ROS Network Configurations.
```
### GOALS:

1. Unmanned mining is one of the most effective methods to solve mine safety and low
    efficiency. This project is the key to accurate localization and mapping for underground
    mining environment.
2. GPS doesn’t work indoors. But it isn’t just indoors that is out of bounds to GPS based
    systems. Forests prove difficult, as tree canopies block the line of sight to the sky. Lidars are
    used

### SPECIFICATIONS:

```
The SLAM BOT presented in this paper consists of different components as shown in Figure,these
components are, the raspberry pi (on board computer on a bot), lidar (to map the unknown
environment) , servo motors (to control lidar) , Arduino (to control motors).

### LEARNING OUTCOMES:

```
In this new era of study, this project will help in learning specific hardware and software that
receives a simple form of artificial intelligence. Students will apply their existing theoretical
knowledge and their experiences regarding product development and design and ergonomics
in an iterative development process.
Simultaneous mapping of the unknown environment through Lidar using Image Processing, OpenCV,
IoT, Matlab, Python, ROS(Robot Operating System).
This project will maintain and develop scientific curiosity and convey respect for scientific values
such as openness, precision, reliability and the importance of distinguishing between knowledge
and opinions.
